# Spoken-Words-Game
A simple game for checking prosody of speech and pronunciation ENGLISH now.

The game was built on the foundation of an AI and machine learning structure which is being developed for a speech and voice recognition system. The system was developed upon the shoulders of an acoustic and a natural language understanding model. 
We are working on our CNN Machine learning algorithm to add more languages and create new functions.

Please contact me if you need further information or you wish to build in specific applications to the program.
